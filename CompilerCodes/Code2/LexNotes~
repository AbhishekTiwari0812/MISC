If r and s are two LEX regular expressions then r/s is another LEX regular expression.
	It matches r if and only if it is followed by an s.
	It is called a trailing context.
	After use in this context, s is then returned to the input before the action is executed. So the action only sees the text matched by r
	Left context is handled by means of start conditions which we will talk about later.

How the input is matched

BASIC PRINCIPLES.

(1)
When the generated scanner is run, it analyses its input string looking for strings which match any of its patterns.
(2)
If the current input can be matched by several expressions, then the ambiguity is resolved by the following rules.
	(2.1)
	The longest match is preferred.
	(2.2)
	The rule given first is preferred.
(3)
Once the match is determined,
	(3.1)
	the text corresponding to it is available in the global character pointer yytext its length is yyleng and the current line number is yylineno,
	(3.2)
	and the action corresponding to the matched pattern is then executed,
	(3.3)
	and then the remaining input is scanned for another match.
