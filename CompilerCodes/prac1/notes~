include "y.tab.h" in lex to make it work with yacc.

values associated with the token will be contained in yylval which is evaluated in lex.
for example 


{INT}	{
		yylval=atoi(yytext);
		return INTEGER;	
	}

To return an operator we use
return *yytext


have to specify y.tab.h in lex and have to specify void yyerror(char *) in yacc
